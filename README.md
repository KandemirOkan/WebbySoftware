Creators of this project require no financial gain from it. Whole purpose of this project was to learn and build fundamentals for these tools along with other things.

WebbySoftware Initiative Portfolio Project is a portfolio created with ASP.NET where Hakan Yıldız and Okan Kandemir worked in collaboration to finalize. Please refer to relevant github pages from here:

The scope of the project is to create a basic portfolio website where we could showcase our works in thumbnails and provide query methods using ASP.NET api/view implementation.

Website is currently live at:

### https://webbysoftinit.azurewebsites.net/ 

WebbySoftware Initiative Portfolio Project is a project completed through webapi and ASP.NET tools.
Users are connected to Development controllers which are categorized as game, web, mobile and desktop development with many to many relationships.

Postgresql cloud db is used to feed the site and its contents. The database was seeded and utilized with a code first approach. 
All content within also has links to relevant github links and, if applicable, web pages, tags, project name and description.
Users also has relevant linkedin pages and github pages with other information such as phone number or contact information.

All different returns were implemented with a different view model, connected through Automapper, respecting "S" of SOLID Principles.
Each project is associated with a User, reflecting project participants.
Later each project is presented on relevant development pages for showcasing. Guests can also use the query tool to search for Users, Project Names and Project tags.

We are aware of websites loading times, it is slow. The whole idea was to bring it up with free services and choices, so the server selection was not as efficient as we could use.

Feel free to give your comments.
